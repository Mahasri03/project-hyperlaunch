IPL Match Winner Predictor
   This project is a **Machine Learning-based application** that predicts the winner of an IPL match using historical match data. It demonstrates the full workflow from data input to model prediction and performance evaluation.

Project Objective
   The goal of this project is to develop a **supervised learning model** that can predict the **winning team** of an IPL match using match-related features such as teams, toss decisions, and venues. It also helps cricket enthusiasts and analysts gain insights into winning patterns.

Dataset Overview:
  
  The dataset contains the following features:

- `season`
- `city`
- `date`
- `match_type`
- `player_of_match`
- `venue`
- `team1`
- `team2`
- `toss_winner`
- `toss_decision`
- `winner` *(Target Variable)*
- ...and more

Visual Insights
   Visualizations were created using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to explore:
   - Top winning teams
   - Impact of toss on match outcome
   - Venue-based winning trends

The project predicts the winning team for an upcoming match like this:  üèÜ Predicted Match Winner: Royal challengers Banglore/Chennai Super Kings
